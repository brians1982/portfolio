**FEA Surrogate Demonstration**

This FEA Surrogate example goes through the steps of: 
  1. Defining parameter definitions and parameter sets for model generation
  2. Creating a parametric FEA model with Abaqus scripting in Python
  3. Solving the models and extracting stress results
  4. Processing stresses to get uniform locations
  5. Training a Neural Network and checking the results

# Brian Shula's Coding Portfolio
A selection of my projects
I have selected several of my Python projects to showcase.  The projects fall into several categories, including Abaqus scripting, Machine Learning, and general uses of Python for fun.

Be sure to browse the project folders:
1. **FEA_Surrogate** - This example shows the steps to crate a FEA Surrogate neural network using Abaqus scripting and Tensorflow.
2. **Image2Contour** - Generates an Abaqus result that matches an image with color depth reduction via K-Means Clustering 
3. **Abaqus_queue** - Elegant batch submission of Abaqus jobs
4. **TemperaturePlot** - Retrieve temperature data from an API, perform unstructured interpolation, and plot within Maine's boundaries
5. **PitchPrediction** - Attempt to train a Neural Network to predict the next type of pitch in a baseball game, based on the pitcher and situation

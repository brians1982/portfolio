I have selected several of my Python projects to showcase.  The projects fall into several categories, including FEA Surrogates via Neural Networks, CAE Automation, AI/ML, and general uses of Python for fun.

Be sure to browse the project folders:
1. **[FEA_Surrogate](https://github.com/brians1982/portfolio/tree/main/FEA_Surrogate)** - This example shows the steps to crate a FEA Surrogate neural network using Abaqus scripting.  Neural Networks are trained using <b>TensorFlow</b> and <b>PyTorch</b>.
2. **[Spring-Mass-PINN](https://github.com/brians1982/portfolio/tree/main/Spring-Mass-PINN)** - A Physics-Informed Neural Network models a spring-mass-damper system described by a second-order ODE. Neural Networks are trained using <b>TensorFlow</b> and <b>PyTorch</b>.
3. **[Kaggle-UBC-OCEAN](https://github.com/brians1982/portfolio/tree/main/Kaggle-UBC-OCEAN)** - This contains my submission from a Kaggle competition to classify medical images by finetuning a pretrained Neural Network.  I scored in the top half of competitors. The Neural Network is trained using <b>TensorFlow</b>.
4. **[Image2Contour](https://github.com/brians1982/portfolio/tree/main/Image2Contour)** - The Notebook generates an Abaqus result that matches an image with color depth reduction via K-Means Clustering. 
5. **[Abaqus_queue](https://github.com/brians1982/portfolio/tree/main/Abaqus_queue)** - The script batch submission of Abaqus jobs in parallel, and is useful for generating FEA surrogate training data.
6. **[TemperaturePlot](https://github.com/brians1982/portfolio/tree/main/TemperaturePlot)** - This notebook retrieves temperature data from a NOAA API, performs unstructured interpolation, and plots smooth contours within Maine's boundaries.
7. **[PitchPrediction](https://github.com/brians1982/portfolio/tree/main/PitchPrediction)** - This Notebook trains a Neural Network to predict the next type of pitch in a baseball game, based on the pitcher and situation. The Neural Network is trained using <b>TensorFlow</b>.

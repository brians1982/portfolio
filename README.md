# Brian Shula's Coding Portfolio

I have selected several of my Python projects to showcase.  The projects fall into several categories, including AI/ML, Abaqus scripting, and general uses of Python for fun.

Be sure to browse the project folders:
1. **FEA_Surrogate** - This example shows the steps to crate a FEA Surrogate neural network using Abaqus scripting and TensorFlow.
2. **Kaggle-UBC-OCEAN** - This contains my submission from a Kaggle competition to classify medical images.  I scored in the top half of competitors.
3. **Image2Contour** - Generates an Abaqus result that matches an image with color depth reduction via K-Means Clustering 
4. **Abaqus_queue** - Elegant batch submission of Abaqus jobs
5. **TemperaturePlot** - Retrieve temperature data from an API, perform unstructured interpolation, and plot within Maine's boundaries
6. **PitchPrediction** - Attempt to train a Neural Network to predict the next type of pitch in a baseball game, based on the pitcher and situation
